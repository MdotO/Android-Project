# DemoRuntastic #

This Demo project is inspired by the idea of Runtastic App , which is a community driven app. People in their vicinity can either 
make requests ,with monetary awards, e.g A request to have someone go grocery shopping for them. People can also naturally take up requests
For detailed information about the requests, not covered by the apps static input details, people can always chat with each other through 
this Application
This is only a Demo based one. Proper Detailed Working on it to follow soon 

## Functionalities : ##

Four basic functionalities are implemented here

### 1) Send requests ###
Users can make requests. Future work include making the scope ,less global or to only specific users or location.

### 2) Receive Requests ###
People can receive requests. Future work includes making filters and penalties for not completing those requests

### 3) Maintain User Profiles ###
Users can maintain their own profiles via a basic Profile Image, Name,status and Location text view for now

### 4) View and Chat with other users ###
Users can view and **chat** with other users!
Currently chat functionality is absed on polling since ParseServer LiveQuery did not seem to work


## My thoughts ##
I believe the **idea** can easily be expanded upon, especially since how it's relatable. Implementation and UI design of course can 
further expand on this idea
